# Tetra

## Full stack reactive component framework for Django using Alpine.js

Tetra is a new full stack component framework for Django, bridging the gap between your server logic and front end presentation. It uses a public shared state and a resumable server state to enable inplace reactive updates. It also encapsulates your Python, HTML, JavaScript and CSS into one file for close proximity of related concerns.
